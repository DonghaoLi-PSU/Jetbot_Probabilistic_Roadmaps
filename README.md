# Jetbot_Probabilistic_Roadmaps  
This allows jetbots to achieve path planning using the Astar algorithm or the Dijkstra algorithm. It is designed for PSU ME435.
Thanks to **Dr. Siu Ling Leung**'s help and hope you enjoy the courses.

This is the Python version of Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) library of Matlab. For a given colored map, you can transfer it to a binary map and create a path between the given Start Point and End Point.
